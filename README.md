#Battle Boat (Battle Ship Clone)
Description:
In this project I implemented a single or two player battleship game clone titled “Battle Boat.” In battle boat each player places a boat on their board. Once the game begins each player then tries to fire at the enemy’s board looking for the enemy ship.
Rules: 
Each player takes turn shooting at the player board consisting of 4x4 pixel quadrants. If the player hit the boat a “O” will be displayed, if the shot missed a ‘X’ will be displayed on the quadrant. The first player to hit all 5 quadrants of the opposing player’s boat wins. In single player mode an AI controls the enemy boat. Once a player wins a trophy will be displayed. Win a player wins, the game can be reset by pressing B taking you back to the MainMenu.
